# Phoneless Web App

This is the web front end for the "Phoneless" app that sends SMS messages via a web app.

It relies on the [api](https://github.com/emlynoregan/phonelessapi) part of the project for its back-end.

## Get Started

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

(All the usual create-react-app stuff.)

## TODO

 - [ ] mock up API
 - [ ] auth
 - [ ] connect to API
 - [ ] style / theme
